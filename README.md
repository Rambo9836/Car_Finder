## Introduction
Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) is caused by viruses from the Ebolavirus. This illness is characterized by a sudden onset of sickness. If not treated, symptoms can be life-threatening. With swift and powerful actions by public health authorities, the threat can be reduced. Outbreaks of this disease have occurred in parts of sub-Sahara Africa, but it is not a disease of the region. Ebola outbreak is a major public health threat at the global level.

This document will give you the clear information on this disease that you need to know about Ebola.  We will examine the ways in which it spreads, the symptoms,

## What Is Ebola?
Ebola is caused by **Ebola viruses** (family **_Filoviridae_**). Different species of Ebola virus exist, and the severity of outbreaks can vary depending on the virus species involved, the speed of detection, and the availability of supportive care and public health resources.

Key points:
- **Incubation period:** typically **2–21 days**
- **Contagiousness:** generally begins **after symptoms start**
- **Severity:** can be high; outcomes depend on early care and outbreak response

## How Ebola Spreads
Ebola spreads through **direct contact** with infectious body fluids, especially when a person is **symptomatic**.

Common transmission routes include:
- Contact with **blood or body fluids** (vomit, stool, urine, saliva, sweat, breast milk, semen) of an infected person
- Contact with **contaminated surfaces or objects** (e.g., bedding, clothing, medical equipment)
- Exposure in healthcare settings when **infection prevention** practices are not followed
- Certain spillover events through contact with infected wildlife (context-dependent)

Notes:
- Ebola is **not typically spread** through casual contact (e.g., sitting near someone) unless there is exposure to infectious fluids.
- Safe care practices and rapid isolation are central to stopping transmission.

## Symptoms
Symptoms can begin suddenly and often include:
- Fever, severe fatigue, weakness
- Headache, muscle and joint pain
- Sore throat
- Vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain
- Rash
- In some cases: unexplained **bleeding or bruising**

Early symptoms can resemble other diseases (such as malaria or typhoid), so **testing is essential**.
---

## Diagnosis
Diagnosis usually involves laboratory testing, such as:
- **RT-PCR** testing to detect viral genetic material  
- Other confirmatory tests depending on the setting and outbreak resources

Public health authorities typically guide who should be tested, based on symptoms and exposure risk.

## Treatment and Care
There is no single “at-home” cure for Ebola. Treatment is generally provided in specialized settings and focuses on:
- **Supportive care:** IV fluids, electrolyte correction, oxygen support, and blood pressure management
- **Managing complications:** organ dysfunction, co-infections, and bleeding risks
- **Targeted therapeutics:** in some outbreaks and for certain Ebola species, specific treatments may be available under approved or guided use

Early medical care improves survival chances.

## Prevention and Control
Effective control relies on coordinated public health action, including:
- **Early detection** and isolation of suspected cases
- **Contact tracing** and monitoring exposed individuals
- Strong **infection prevention and control (IPC)** in healthcare facilities (PPE, safe injections, disinfection)
- **Safe and dignified burials** to prevent exposure during funeral practices
- **Vaccination** strategies in outbreak contexts (when available and recommended)

## Conclusion
**Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) is a highly contagious illness, outbreak of which can happen without accessing timely clinical care and implementing appropriate public health intervention. Ebola virus outbreak prevention and control requires a basic understanding of how the virus spreads, what symptoms are associated with Ebola, and proven strategies.
The effective isolation and contact tracing of Ebola patients; safe care of these patients; and safe and dignified burial. In certain instances, immunization might also be employed.**
